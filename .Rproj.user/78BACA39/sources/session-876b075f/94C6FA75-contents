Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains all of the **.Rmd files and datasets** used in the Winter 2021 offering of **BIS 15L: Data Science for Biologists** at UC Davis.

## 📘 About This Repository
This repo was created while I served as a **Teaching Assistant (TA)** for the course.  
It includes reproducible teaching materials, example analyses, and supporting datasets used in class.

## 🏫 Teaching Context (Winter 2021)
At the time, I was a **sixth-year Ph.D. candidate** in the **Plant Biology Graduate Program** at UC Davis.  
I had 3 years of experience as a TA across several courses, including:  
- 🌱 **PLB111** – Plant Physiology  
- 🌱 **PLB112** – Plant Growth and Development  
- 🌱 **BIS2C** – Introduction to Biology: Biodiversity and the Tree of Life  

Serving as a TA allowed me to apply what I had learned in coursework and lab research, while sharing my knowledge with students.

Although this repository reflects my role as a TA at the time, my current position is different.  
I’ve kept the README information intact to preserve the historical context of the course.
