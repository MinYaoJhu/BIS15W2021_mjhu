I am a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Plant Biology Graduate Program at UC Davis.
I have 3 years of experience teaching as a teaching assistant for several courses, including Plant Physiology (PLB111), Plant Growth and Development (PLB112), and Introduction to Biology: Biodiversity and the Tree of Life (BIS2C). I enjoyed the opportunity to put what I had learned in my courses and lab research into practice on teaching students.
